        "Qs2.What are the types of random variables?\n",
        "- The two main types of random variables are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Discrete random variable** – takes specific, separate values (e.g., number of heads in coin tosses).\n",
        "2. **Continuous random variable** – takes any value within a range (e.g., height, temperature).\n",
        "Qs3.What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions/\n",

        "Qs4.What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "- A **probability distribution function (PDF)** describes how probabilities are distributed over the values of a random variable. For discrete variables, it's called a **probability mass function (PMF)**, and for continuous variables, it's the **probability density function (PDF)**.\n",
