        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which contain data (attributes) and code (methods). It focuses on organizing code using classes and objects, and key principles include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\n",
        "- 1. **Encapsulation** – Bundles data and methods that operate on the data within one unit (class), hiding internal details from the outside.  \n",
        "2. **Inheritance** – Allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, promoting code reusability.  \n",
        "3. **Polymorphism** – Enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, allowing methods to perform differently based on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class in OOP is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "# 3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object in OOP is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with defined attributes and behaviors as outlined by its class.\n",
        "#4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "**Abstraction** is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and allows the programmer to focus on interactions rather than inner workings.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Encapsulation** is the practice of wrapping data and the code that manipulates it into a single unit, usually a class, and restricting access to some components. This protects the data from unintended interference and misuse.\n",
        "# 5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods in Python are special methods with double underscores at the beginning and end of their names (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`). They are used to define how objects behave with built-in functions and operators.\n",
        "#6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPs?\n",
        "- Inheritance in OOP is a mechanism where a class (child or subclass) inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent or superclass). It promotes code reuse and allows for hierarchical class structures.\n",
        "#7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- **Polymorphism** in OOP means the ability of a single function or method to behave differently based on the object calling it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```java\n",
        "Animal a = new Dog();  \n",
        "a.sound(); // Output: Dog barks\n",
        "```\n",
        "#8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using private variables (with `_` or `__`) and getter/setter methods to control access.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self): self.__age = 0  # private variable\n",
        "    def set_age(self, age): self.__age = age  # setter\n",
        "    def get_age(self): return self.__age  # getter\n",
        "```\n",
        "#9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "A **constructor** in Python is a special method `__init__` that automatically runs when an object is created, used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "p = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
        "print(p.name)  # Output: Alice\n",
        "```\n",
        "#10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "**Class method**: A method that takes `cls` as the first parameter and can access or modify class state.  \n",
        "**Static method**: A method that doesn’t access class or instance data; it’s just like a regular function inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class MyClass:\n",
        "    @classmethod\n",
        "    def cls_method(cls): print(\"I'm a class method\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    @staticmethod\n",
        "    def static_method(): print(\"I'm a static method\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "#11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "**Method overloading in Python** means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. However, Python doesn't support true method overloading like some other languages — only the last defined method is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Demo:\n",
        "    def show(self, a=None, b=None):\n",
        "        if a and b:\n",
        "            print(a, b)\n",
        "        elif a:\n",
        "            print(a)\n",
        "```\n",
        "#12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "**Method overriding** in OOP is when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example in Python:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Bark\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, `Dog` overrides the `sound` method of `Animal`.\n",
        "#13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "A **property decorator** in Python (`@property`) lets you define a method that can be accessed like an attribute. It’s commonly used to get, set, or delete values with method logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self._name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "    @property\n",
        "    def name(self):\n",
        "        return self._name\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Now `p.name` behaves like an attribute, but it's actually calling the `name()` method.\n",
        "#14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism is important in OOP because it makes code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain by allowing one interface to handle different types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example in Python:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self): pass\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self): print(\"Bark\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self): print(\"Meow\")\n",
        "\n",
        "for animal in [Dog(), Cat()]:\n",
        "    animal.speak()  # Outputs: Bark, Meow\n",
        "```\n",
        "#15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "An **abstract class** in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and often includes one or more abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses. It’s defined using the `abc` module.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "class Animal(ABC):\n",
        "    @abstractmethod\n",
        "    def sound(self):\n",
        "        pass\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Subclasses must implement the `sound()` method to be instantiated.\n",
        "#16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "Advantages of OOP+ (in short):\n",
        "\n",
        "- Modularity: Code is structured into classes and objects.\n",
        "- Reusability: Inheritance lets you reuse existing code.\n",
        "- Flexibility: Polymorphism allows one interface, multiple implementations.\n",
        "- Security: Encapsulation hides internal data.\n",
        "- Maintainability: Easier to update and debug code.\n",
        "- Real-world modeling: Mimics real-life entities for better design.\n",
        "#17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "**Class variable** is shared by all instances of a class, while an **instance variable** is unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    wheels = 4  # class variable\n",
        "    def __init__(self, color):\n",
        "        self.color = color  # instance variable\n",
        "```\n",
        "#18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "**Multiple Inheritance** in Python means a class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class A: pass\n",
        "class B: pass\n",
        "class C(A, B): pass\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, class `C` inherits from both `A` and `B`.\n",
        "#19.H Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "In Python, `__str__` is used to define a user-friendly string representation of an object, while `__repr__` is meant to provide an unambiguous string for developers (often used for debugging).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __str__(self):\n",
        "        return \"User-friendly output\"\n",

        "print(repr(p))  # Output: Developer debug output\n",
        "```\n",
        "#20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "The `super()` function in Python is used to call a method from the parent class, allowing access to inherited methods without explicitly naming the parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Parent:\n",

        "        print(\"Hello from Child\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "#21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "The `__del__` method in Python is a destructor that's called when an object is about to be destroyed, helping with cleanup like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",

        "```python\n",
        "class Demo:\n",
        "    def __del__(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Object is being deleted\")\n",

        "\n",
        "Calling `Dog().speak()` prints `Bark`, overriding the parent method.\n",
        "#24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "**Method chaining** in Python OOP is calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line, where each method returns the object itself.\n",
